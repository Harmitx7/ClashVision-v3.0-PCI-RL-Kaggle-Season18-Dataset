5. **Performance Boost**: Continuous improvement through reinforcement learning

### 📊 Training Data Mix
```
Synthetic Dataset (Pattern-based):  50,000 matches (Weight: 1.0)
Recent Matches (Live):              Up to 10,000 matches (Weight: 2.0)
Total Training Power:               ~70,000 effective samples
```
